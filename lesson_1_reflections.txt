How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It isolated only the lines that had been changed, saving mental work.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

reduce worry that I broke something, and have handy working versions if something breaks.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

With Git, the commits can make much more logical sense, and therefore be more useful. On the downside, you have to remember to do it frequently enough.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use the log command to find commits (use the down key to scroll, q to quit). Use git diff with both commit names to view differences
